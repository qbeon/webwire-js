# WebWire.js
A JavaScript client implementation for the [webwire-go](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go) asynchronous messaging library.
This library implements the webwire binary protocol version 1.0 and provides the following features:

- **Request-Reply** - Multiple asynchronous requests can be performed against the server.
- **Server-side Signals** - Server-side signals can be handled.
- **Client-side Signals** - Can send signals to the server.
- **Sessions** - Handles and synchronizes sessions automagically making authentication a piece of cake.
